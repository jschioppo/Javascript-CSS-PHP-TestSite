# Javascript-CSS-PHP-TestSite
Cloned Google search engine for practice with HTML/CSS/Javascript. Search button does a Google Search of the contents of the search bar, and the Find a Gif button posts one of five fun gifs using Javascript, just for laughs. 

Also created a small user database and made a simple registration and login page. Used jQuery/Ajax for client side and PHP for server side. 

This project was just to practice Javascript, HTML, CSS, and PHP outside of a framework or IDE to better learn how they work and interoperate, as well as sharpen my skills with those tools. 

Everything was made in Notepad++ and written from scratch.
